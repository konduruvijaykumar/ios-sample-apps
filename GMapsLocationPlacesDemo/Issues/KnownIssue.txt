I am facing the issue mentioned in the image KnownIssue. I donâ€™t get any error stack to find out the issue, EXC_BAD_ACCESS
1) This only occurs when we execute the app via Xcode on a connected iPhone. When we stop the app from Xcode and run app on phone it works fine.
2) This does not occur on simulator or phone.

If any one knows the solution, please let me know.
